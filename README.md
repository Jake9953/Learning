GitHub is the industry-standard tool for collaborating on and sharing code. It’s popular among software developers, project managers, designers, and students for its flexibility and control. This course introduces GitHub and Git, the version control system that GitHub is built upon. Instructor Emanuele Bartolesi shows how GitHub can create collaborative workflows for you and your team. Explore how version control enables you and your team to track the changes in your files, maintain a history of them, and get some advice to work better with open-source projects. Emanuele gives you the knowledge you need to be able to select appropriate projects to be pushed to GitHub, successfully initialize Git on an existing project, leverage the power of GitHub Copilot, and navigate the GitHub UI to perform common tasks like branching, commits, pull requests, and more.

This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace. Check out the “What is Codespaces?” video to learn how to get started.
